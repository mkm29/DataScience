    "## Processing and analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is a two-part problem: First, process the data from its original form (blocks of text or speech) into a form the computer can understand, then conduct analysis on the processed data. Step one, which we will address in this assignment, may involve elements of data cleaning and feature extraction. When dealing with verbal information, this step is called _language parsing_.  Domain knowledge (information about word frequency, meaning, and grammar) is applied to raw text to extract features of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall that in Unit 2, we built a spam filter with a Naive Bayes classifier. The spam filter parsed individual email messages and created a series of binary features indicating the presence or absence of a set of keywords that we assumed would discriminate between spam and non-spam emails. The process of coding the presence or absence of keywords is a very simple example of language parsing. Now, we are going to go much deeper.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with two different NLP packages: [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and [spaCy](https://spacy.io).  NLTK, or Natural Language ToolKit, is a seasoned package with great richness and depth. It is good for learning language parsing because it is highly customizeable and transparent. On the other hand, it also contains many older models and methods that are useful for teaching NLP but are not optimal for production code. spaCy is almost the direct opposite. Rather than offering language parsing options, spaCy just processes text data using whatever algorithms and methods are considered \"state of the art\". It is considerably leaner, and because it is written in Cython (meaning Python code is translated into C and then run), it is considerably faster. On the other hand, we lose the virtue of choice, and if spaCy's algorithms change, our results could change as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we'll use some of the text corpora (bodies of text) from NLTK, but will process them with spaCy. We'll also use regular expressions (the standard library package `re`) when we want to pull a very specific element of text out of a string, usually before passing the text to spaCy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin. First, if you haven't used NLTK yet, you'll want to install the package with `pip install nltk`. Then, run the cell below to launch an [interactive installer](http://www.nltk.org/data.html#interactive-installer). Using the installer, choose the \"corpora\" tab and download the \"gutenberg\" and \"stopwords\" corpora."

One class of potentially-uninformative tokens is _stop words_, words used very frequently that don't have much informational value, such as \"the\" and \"of\".
