## Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

1. **Versions**
    * **A** - control group, given placebo
    * **B** - experiment group, given actual supplement that is supposed to aid in sleeping
2. **Sample**
    * You could just randomly assign customers to the two groups; however, this could introduce sampling bias; you will probably need to collect additional information such as gender, age, medical conditions and current prescriptions. 
3. **Hypothesis**
    * First, we must address the question: what do you mean by sleep better? This could mean falling asleep quicker or staying asleep longer. As I have been personally been trying to conduct a sleep analysis on my own sleeping patters, recording information on the quality/duration of sleep is difficult, so for this test we will consider the former: does this supplement aid users in falling asleep quicker? This will still require customer to self-report how fast they fell asleep, so the question could be assessed by simply looking at the purchasing rates of both groups (with the marketing ploy of making you fall asleep quicker). 
4. **Outcome**
    * We will be measuring a different outcome for the above hypotheses:
    1. Fall asleep faster: In order to minimize subjectivity, we will simply ask all customers to report how long it took them to fall asleep, each night for 14 days. 
    2. Improved quality of sleep: ask all customers to report how long they remained asleep, for 14 days. This could be done in a more clinical setting, where breathing patterns are also measured (just from sound), thus quality of sleep can be reported as the percentage of total time slept spent in deep REM sleep.
    3. This would be the easiest test to conduct (of the 3 mentioned), but you would not necessarily be assessing the supplement's ability to improve sleep, rather the company's ability to market and sell the supplement. However, our data will suffer less bias.

## Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

1. The first thing to do in most experimental design is to get a clearer definition of the question at hand. A gym's business could indicate a lot of things: increased membership, increased consistency among members, increased referral rate or even increased concession sales (protein shakes). We will run into sampling/bias errors for the first question, so let's tackle the question of will new uniforms lead to longer times spent at the gym. Furthermore, the question is fairly ambiguous, does the new uniform only have a different color than the original? Or does it also have a new design? We need to try to identify individual factors, rather than multiple factors at once. 
2. **Versions**
    * This question will require we take time into account: day and time of week need to be consistent among the groups. This introduces the problem of staff wearing both uniforms during the same time slot, so a lot of attention must be paid to sampling. 
    * **A** - control group, gym staff wear existing uniforms 
    * **B** - gym staff wear new uniforms
3. **Sample**
    * First a time series analysis must be conducted to determine if there are significant differences in time spent at the gym (daily/hourly). If there is no statistically significant difference, our sampling becomes easy. If, however, there is, we might not be able to conduct the A/B test with regard to this question.
    * Let's assume that the gym in question is only open 12 hours a day, 7 days a week (a total of 84 hours). Thus, we partition the time slots into 42 hours each, and randomly assign our customers to, say, 5 1-hour time slots for the week. Age and gender should also be taken into consideration when sampling, both groups should contain a comparable mixture of genders and ages.
5. **Hypothesis**
    * The new uniforms (color change) will increase the typical time spent at the gym.
4. Outcome:
    * The time spent at the gym is easily recorded by check-in and check-out timestamps (members will be required to sign in at the front desk before and after each session
    * The gym will also know the uniforms worn for a particular time slot. We can then compute key metrics (such as average time spent) for each group.  


## Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?

1. Let's define improve: increase sales. 
2. Versions:
    * **A** - control group - old homepage
    * **B** - experimental group - new homepage
3. Sample:
    * We need to ensure homogeneity among the two groups, which will require us to collect additional information such as gender, age and existing pets. We can record the IP address of all customers, and from this we can obtain a geographic location which also needs to be even among the 2 groups. Timestamps will also need to be accounted for, from these we can get the time of the day that customer visited our page, how long they stay on our site, and we can even record clicks. 
4. Hypothesis:
    * We guess that a newly designed homepage will lead to increased conversion rates.
5. **Outcome**
    * Again, this is all dependent on the question being asked. In regard to conversion rates (sales), this number is easily measured. Same with clicks and time spent on website. 


## If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?

1. This is a rather vague question: how do we measure if a person has read my email? Let's say that the email asks for users to reply or click a link. This information is actually measurable, a person actually reading an email is quite subjective. 
2. **Versions** 
    * We just randomly assign people to receive one of the two emails.
3. **Sample**
    * If we are able to collect additional information such as gender, age and location this information should be consistent among the two groups.
4. **Hypothesis**
    * Adding "please read" to an email subject will increase the response rate (reply or clicking a link). 
5. **Outcome**
    * The response rate to an email. We can also use the time a reply was sent, or when a link was clicked, to see if the time of day is also a factor in modulating the response rate.
