# Sith Lords

  * Selection bias: subjects are all captured, so they will already be biased towards both slogans. (Samples must not be homogeneous.)
    * Could also fall under Bias in assignment to conditions? 
  * The people presenting the slogans are quite famous, which introduces observer bias. One, neutral party needs to present both.

# Jedi

  * A few things are wrong here. First, as mentioned above this study will suffer from observer bias. A neutral party must be the one presenting their side. 
  * The sizes of the planets need to be accounted for, aka Simpson's paradox. The planets Jar Jar was deployed to persuade to come over to their side might all be tiny, relative to those that Mace Windu was assigned, so we also have bias in assignment to conditions. This suggests a different variable is responsible for this: population. For example, the 4 planets that Jar Jar was sent to have a combined population of 100 (so he successfully persuaded 75 of them), whereas Mace Windu converted 130 out of 200 people. 

# Company Satisfaction

  * When designing an experiment to test the effects of one change, everything else needs to remain constant. The overall mental health levels might vary widely among the countries, leading to selection bias. We cannot have one group consist of mainly depressed people as this does not generalize to the population. Furthermore, the concentration of department (HR versus IT) must comparable, as we do not want one group to consist primarily of HR employees (this could lead to Simpson's paradox). Furthermore, there may be some contextual bias present in this study, also contributing to selection bias. The mental health levels may be very volatile among HR employees, and they could already be predisposed to hating their job. 

# Fitness App

  * Selection bias; people who install these types of apps may already be quite active. Furthermore, this increase might only exist for users one week after they install the app and then they fall back into old habits. We could also have some contextual bias here, large data breaches may have just occurred leading to less overall users agreeing to share their data, but this particular sub-population is extremely active (outliers).

# Cheating

  * In this study, we see bias in assignment to conditions and selection bias, as the randomization process of assigning a test version to a student is flawed. Typically, the more engaged students arrive first so they will all get version A, leading to higher scores on version A compared to the other 2 versions. Thus, the assigned version depends on time, so our conclusions could be due more to time rather than the version of the test.
