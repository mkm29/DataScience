## You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

  * This would suggest contextual bias; however, I really need to know the geographic location targeted: if the ads target Miami, there may not be that big of a difference among the 2 groups (very little seasonality in southern Florida) compared to if you are targeting Cape Cod. 

## You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

  * Selection bias. You would expect higher levels of anxiety in a place where anxiety is treated, so you cannot compare this with the general population. 

## You launch a new ad billboard-based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

  * Recency bias; the sample size might be too small. Consider extending the time period. 

## You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

  * Bias in assignment to conditions, maybe you are primarily selecting users who have not visited your site in a long time, check other factors like age that are over/underrepresented in your sample. It may be the people running the study, check if the program was even communicated to your users.
