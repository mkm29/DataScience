# Drill: Formulating good research questions

  *Disclaimer: classifying a question as "good" or "bad" is quite subjective.*

1. What is the 1994 rate of juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
  * Bad: Very vague/broad question: these rates are readily available, so this is easy to report, little to no analysis is needed. You could drill down into the general population to observe differences in specific groups to make this a question more suited to data analysis.

2. What can we do to reduce juvenile delinquency in the U.S.?
  * Good: This is a more specific question, visualizing the data first should help to identify areas where the delinquency rate is higher than other areas and target these groups (age, gender, race, urban/rural, education), and from this information you could propose an A/B experiment to test a hypothesis on one of these groups.

3. Does education play a role in reducing juvenile delinquents' return to crime?
  * Good: Education could play a vital role in delinquency rates, as noted above, so this could be a very promising feature to split on. 

4. How many customers does AT&T currently serve in Washington, DC?
  * Bad: Once again, this is simply a number that is readily/easily available, where data analysis may not be needed. Possible change: what percent of the DC area is served by AT&T compared to NYC?

5. What factors lead consumers to choose AT&T over other service providers?
  *  Bad: once again too vague. Do price differences among cellular providers lead to more consumers?

6. How can AT&T attract more customers?
  * Bad: we can use the results from the previous question to postulate another question; if we decrease the price of plans will we see more customers?

7. Why did the Challenger Shuttle explode?
  * Bad (O-ring failure I believe): what are the most likely reasons the Challenger exploded? (probabilities)

8. Which genes are associated with increased risk of breast cancer?
  * Bad: (my old area of research!); you should re-formulate the question as "most likely" genes involved in cellular signaling that lead to the development of breast cancer. This can be accomplished via graph theory to identify candidates and mRNAi ("knock-down") studies to validate your prediction(s). 

9. Is it better to read to children at night or in the morning?
  * Bad: what do you mean by better? Does reading to children at night (versus morning) increase the rate at which they fall asleep?

10. How does Googleâ€™s search algorithm work?
  * Bad: this is more of an algorithm analysis question than a data analysis question. What are the most searched terms: morning vs. night?
