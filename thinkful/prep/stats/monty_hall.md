# Monty Hall Problem

My intuition told me that sticking with your initial choice or switching doors would equate to the same probability of winning the car, however after reading the wiki article I realized that my intuion was wrong and that I should have written it down to validate! I was assuming that the host's choice to open a door was also random, however they are conditioned on choosing a door that does not conceal the prize, and when this conditional probability is considered your probability of winning the car increases from 1/3 to 2/3 when you switch. Lesson: do not assume independence, first you should always check this.
