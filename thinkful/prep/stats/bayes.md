# Baye's Rule - Drills

The question is somewhat vague, and thus I am not entirely sure what you are asking in 1-4 so I will define and compute what I believe you are asking.


1. **TP+TN** = 0.98*0.005+0.1*0.995 = 0.1044
  * **or** is the question asking this: **P(+|D)** = TP/(TP+FP) =  = 0.04693487
2. 0.98
4. 0.9
4. (FP+FN)/(TP+FP+TN+FN) = (0.1*0.995+0.02*0.005)/(0.1*0.995+0.02*0.005+0.98*0.005+0.9*0.995) = 0.0996
