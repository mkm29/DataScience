# Data Sources - Drills

## 1. AirBnB
The data collected occurs during Christmas so we are dealing with an exceptional circumstance. You have a few options here: you can either collect more data from other dates (non-holidays) or reframe your conclusion to what are the popular neighborhoods in Amsterdam during the Christmas holidays? 

## 2. Metal health
Again, this data is an exceptional circumstancem, that being the day after September 11. You would expect the trends/patterns around the New York area to be different/abnormal than that of other cities in the country around that time. You need to adjust your question to clearly state this case, possibly changing the question to how does mental health services use differ in cities across the US from that of New York City the day following September 11. 

# 3: American Pub Survey

If the survey disseminated to people who frequent pubs more than typical Americans?
