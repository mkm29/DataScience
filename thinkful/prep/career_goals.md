# Ideal Job

1. I spent the majority of my undergraduate education researching ways of applying computer science and math to solving problems in field of biology, specifically cancer research. Therefore, my ideal job would delve deeper into employing these techniques in order to transform the way people are diagnosed and treated in the healthcare arena. There is a plethora of biological data out there, but in isolation these sources can only answer a subset of problems; consolidating this information into a centralized database via data mining, and regular expressions can give you the ability to address a lot more. For example, you can obtain high-throughput mRNAi data from lab experiments designed to “knock down” certain genes, combine many of these studies with known human pathway information in order to predict genes (proteins) that are likely to be involved in cellular signaling. These candidate proteins can then be the focus of new medications/therapies. 

2. A big issue when it comes to cancer is the growth and spread of tumorous cells. A tumor cell is told that it should grow without bound, and then spread to other areas of the body. Why and how are these cells told to do this? When it comes to how they are told to do this, a large factor is cellular signaling. What happens here is a cascade of proteins “talk” to each other (by increasing or decreasing their concentration), so if we can intervene somewhere along this path, we can consequently control this growth, potentially reducing the size and spread of these tumorous cells.

3. Using modeling, graph theory and other mathematical techniques and data mining/regular expressions, candidate proteins involved in cellular signaling can be identified. These genes can then be tested in a laboratory setting to see what, if any, effect they have on the growth and spread of tumor cells.
